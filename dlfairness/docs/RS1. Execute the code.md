# RS1. Executing Code for Reproduced Papers

In this step, you will execute the code of each technique in our experiment. Generally speaking, each technique can be split into four parts:
* Prepare the dataset
* Prepare the paths in the execution script
* Run the script
* Obtain the results

You can read [RS1.1](<RS1.1 Technique S.md>) for Technique "S", [RS1.2](<RS1.2 Technique C and I.md>) for Technique "C" and "I", [RS1.3](<RS1.3 Technique A.md>), and [RS1.4](<RS1.4 Technique N.md>) for Technique "N" in the paper. Each of the file contains the four parts above.

## What you need for this step

**Define** `shared_dir`, `working_dir`, `modified_target_dir`, `NAS_DIR`, and `RESULT_DIR` for all four reproduced papers
