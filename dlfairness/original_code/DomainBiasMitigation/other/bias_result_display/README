Aggregation of all the raw results

Display them in LaTeX table, box plot etc.

File format:
Each model has four files: overall stat result (max, min, etc.); per-class stat result; overall raw value; overall per-class value
Each file contains all the settings (baseline vs. all the mitigations)

in 'stats', DI is 1-DI for comparison
Do NOT use this for printing tables
